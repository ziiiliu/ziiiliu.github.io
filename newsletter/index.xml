      <description>Intro Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Ziyi, and you are reading my very first newsletter. I&amp;rsquo;ll be frank in the very beginning: I am not writing to cater to your tastes, and my biggest patron and vip subscriber is myself, which is exactly why I started this project.
Journaling has been a big hurdle in my entire life, despite my multiple attempts at it in different stages of life for vastly different reasons. In childhood, keeping a diary was a recurring homework for school, and as I was a rather absentminded and playful kid, not many events or thoughts really remain in my brain when I have to reluctantly pick up my pencil and rush a piece on Sunday night - so I have to make up some random stories.</description>
