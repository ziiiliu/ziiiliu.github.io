      <description>Last week was my first meeting with Flask and pretty much the concept of web development, since it was at most &amp;ldquo;Heads up HTML&amp;rdquo; in the past. This week I will be dabbling a bit on basic Flask features and usages, templates, template inheritance and Bootstrap framework.
Flask basics Firstly, quoting flask website:
 A Flask application is an instance of the Flask class. Everything about the application, such as configuration and URLs, will be registered with this class.</description>

      <description>So after delaying this website project for almost a year, I&amp;rsquo;m back online and will be producing weekly microblogs(stressful terms, sorry) on CS-related contents, as well as other random blogs about life. In the meantime I am still familiarising myself with Hugo, so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if the structuring and themes get a bit whimsical - or actually I might just do it for fun :)))
Flask and Django Web develpment has not been my top priority, and it is only very recently(last two days) that I decided to start picking up Python web dev as a start.</description>
